title: An Eternal Palmer - The 1980s Never Ends
---
As a distinguished contemporary poet who has been leaving the literary world for more than twenty years, XiaoHua Li published the autobiography full-length novel《Patient of the Centry》in 2014 to announce his formal return, standing for the return of literary spirit of 1980s.

Li suspended his writing career just right after he has received tremendous honor during 1980s. Then he marooned himself by attempting on academic research, business and migration. Deep homesick could be identified by the description in his book during the whole time as for the disillusioned dream and broken faith in such a turbulent real world. There are three kinds of prisoners described on his book to express his personal schizobulia mourning the loss of freedom. 

Dramatically Li had never lost himself as an ideal poet after going through such huge frustration. He turned from a strongly patriotic officer and famous poet into womanishly fussy man seemingly, but he never forgot his identity as a campaigner. His early creation mostly focuses on lost and discovery from realism to idealism with temperament of officer and poet floating around to figuring out the question of "Who am I". 《Patient of the Centry》did make a break through while it always maintained its overwhelmingly sacred spirit. Concerning the literary form and gramma, Li kept an eye on different style and struggled for a better way to express his own literatrue.

Abundant memory coming along with Li's return lead to his introspection for society. As an experimental literary form, 《Blue Plateau》acquired public attention during that time while it never make an impact on the whole history of literature, just like Li, probably because of the absence of him. Apparently the radical social environment and the popular third-generation poetry of the day and experience of Li himself wouldn't comprehensively allow this kind of literary form to spread out. Li kept revealing reminiscence and the feeling about politics, economy and personal situation in his research on 1980s in memory of the missing collectivism and liberation. Anyway, the return of poets like Li means that the 1980s never actually ends which we should always appreciate.
